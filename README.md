# Insurance Solutions Omnium Singapore

The WIP project for an insurtech web application, Omnium offers multiple advantages to buying insurance.

Offering policies from major brands in Singapore, users can view and learn more about policies to either purchase directly, or request the help of an advisor for support through an inquiry, chatting with them on a chat system built in the application.




#### Authentication & Security

Secure log in and sign up, along with the option for Google sign-in.

Custom user attributes have been set up to improve security and provide more specific user-based permissions.

#### Chat

Omnium provides a built in custom chat messaging system to allow conversations between advisors and policy buyers to connect.

The buyer simply has to send an inquiry on the dedicated page for the policy they are interested in, and Omnium disperses the inquiry until an advisor picks it up.

Once an advisor picks it up, only they will be able to see the inquiry and allow for follow-ups.

#### Custom User attributes

Permissions and user data such as assessment results are tied to a custom user attribute system developed, allowing greater versatility in nearly every aspect of providing a better user experience.


## Roadmap

- Allow users to get policy documents to purchase immediately after confirmation that they are eligible for the plan.

## Notes

This project was created to showcase the possibilities of insurtech applications in Singapore to enhance the mundane and typically tedious processes everyone is used to in buying insurance.

Special permissions have been set to allow users to toggle between user roles so that they can experience the site from every role.
